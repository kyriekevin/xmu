  The line graph shows the main reasons people gave for moving away from a particular capital city to the countryside.

Summary
What's the framework?
What's the general trend?

  The line graph demonstrates the main motivations people expressed for relocating to the countryside from urban area of a capital city in 1990, 2000 and 2010. The years witnessed a large number of people moving away.

Group one
Why grouping (commonality)?
Comparison and key features

  According to the graph, the major reason for relocation was the rising cost of living. In 1990, 65,000 people left the city because of this, then the number peaked at 85,000 in 2000, before going down a bit by 5,000 in the decade between 2000 and 2010.

Group two
Why grouping (commonality)?
Comparison and key features

  It was a different story for traffic and lifestyle: both had the same number of city leavers at 20,000 at the start of the period, much lower than that of rising cost of living. Subsequently, both categories saw increases, with traffic first going up by a large number to 35,000 by the year 2000, and then even more steeply to 60,000 by 2010; Lifestyle leavers rose consistently over the whole period, going eventually up to 40,000.
