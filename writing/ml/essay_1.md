Task 2:

Some people think that we should try our best to protect animals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

In modern society, protecting animals has never failed to attract people's attention. Some people hold the view that we should spare no effort to protect animals. Even though I think it is not easy to reach a clear conclusion, I still think it is of great rationality.

For one thing, protecting animals is an effective method to maintain the balance of ecosystem. Because the quality of ecosystem is positively related to the variety as well as amount of species. For example, a recent research released by HKU showed the result that the increasing number of animal protecting areas played a significant role in environmental protection. More and more people choose to devote themselves to the field of animal protection. Therefore, it is necessary to protect animals.

For another, what matters most in the development of medical technology is the resources of animal species, which requires a high level of animal protection. Because many of the results in medical technology need experiments on animals. And it is the booming of medical science that ensure the quality of our lives. To be more specific, when solving the problems of Covid-19, many scientists tried to find solutions by many animal experiments. Fortunately, they managed to create the vaccine of the pandemic, which saved millions of human lives. Thus, protecting animals is protecting ourselves.

In conclusion, I think we should try our best to protect the animals due to the reason that it is also a way to protect the environment as well as our own lives.
