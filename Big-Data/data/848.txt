title: [PATCH] Fix double decrement of mqueue_mnt->mnt_count in sys_mq_open
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=7c7dce9209161eb260cdf9e9172f72c3a02379e6
lines: -26/+33
category: ipc/mqueue.c

Fixed the refcounting on failure exits in sys_mq_open() and
cleaned the logics up.  Rules are actually pretty simple - dentry_open()
expects vfsmount and dentry to be pinned down and it either transfers
them into created struct file or drops them.  Old code had been very
confused in that area - if dentry_open() had failed either in do_open()
or do_create(), we ended up dentry and mqueue_mnt dropped twice, once
by dentry_open() cleanup and then by sys_mq_open().

Fix consists of making the rules for do_create() and do_open()
same as for dentry_open() and updating the sys_mq_open() accordingly;
that actually leads to more straightforward code and less work on
normal path.
