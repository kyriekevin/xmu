When a filesystem decrements i_nlink to zero, it means that a write must be
performed in order to drop the inode from the filesystem.

We're shortly going to have keep filesystems from being remounted r/o between
the time that this i_nlink decrement and that write occurs.

So, add a little helper function to do the decrements.  We'll tie into it in a
bit to note when i_nlink hits zero.
