title: hugetlbfs: fix alignment of huge page requests
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=40716e29243de46720e5773797791466c28904ec
lines: -1/+1
category: ipc/shm.c

When calling shmget() with SHM_HUGETLB, shmget aligns the request size to
PAGE_SIZE, but this is not sufficient.

Modify hugetlb_file_setup() to align requests to the huge page size, and
to accept an address argument so that all alignment checks can be
performed in hugetlb_file_setup(), rather than in its callers.  Change
newseg() and mmap_pgoff() to match the new prototype and eliminate a now
redundant alignment check.
