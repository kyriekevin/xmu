title: fix undefined reference to user_shm_unlock

My 353d5c30c666580347515da609dd74a2b8e9b828 "mm: fix hugetlb bug due to
user_shm_unlock call" broke the CONFIG_SYSVIPC !CONFIG_MMU build of both
2.6.31 and 2.6.30.6: "undefined reference to `user_shm_unlock'".

gcc didn't understand my comment! so couldn't figure out to optimize
away user_shm_unlock() from the error path in the hugetlb-less case, as
it does elsewhere.  Help it to do so, in a language it understands.
