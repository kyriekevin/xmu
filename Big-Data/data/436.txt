title: ipc,sem: fix semctl(..., GETNCNT)
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=de2657f94acd4f0df44626db7c4d2b71babc8cd3
lines: -0/+7
category: ipc/sem.c

The semctl GETNCNT returns the number of semops waiting for the
specified semaphore to become nonzero.  After commit 9f1bc2c9022c
("ipc,sem: have only one list in struct sem_queue"), the semops waiting
on just one semaphore are waiting on that semaphore's list.

In order to return the correct count, we have to walk that list too, in
addition to the sem_array's list for complex operations.
