title: [PATCH] Fix semundo lock leakage

semundo->lock can leak if semundo->refcount goes from 2 to 1 while
another thread has it locked.  This causes major problems for PREEMPT
kernels.

The simplest fix for now is to undo the single-thread optimization.

This bug was found via relentless testing by Dominik Karall.
