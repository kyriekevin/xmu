title: sched/headers: Prepare for new header dependencies before moving code to â†µ
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=84f001e15737f8214b0f5f0f7dfec0fb1027938f

<linux/sched/wake_q.h>

We are going to split <linux/sched/wake_q.h> out of <linux/sched.h>, which
will have to be picked up from other headers and a couple of .c files.

Create a trivial placeholder <linux/sched/wake_q.h> file that just
maps to <linux/sched.h> to make this patch obviously correct and
bisectable.

Include the new header in the files that are going to need it.
