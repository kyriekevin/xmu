Pull (again) user namespace infrastructure changes from Eric Biederman:
 "Those bugs, those darn embarrasing bugs just want don't want to get
  fixed.

  Linus I just updated my mirror of your kernel.org tree and it appears
  you successfully pulled everything except the last 4 commits that fix
  those embarrasing bugs.

  When you get a chance can you please repull my branch"

* 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace:
  userns: Fix typo in description of the limitation of userns_install
  userns: Add a more complete capability subset test to commit_creds
  userns: Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for most uses of setns.
  Fix cap_capable to only allow owners in the parent user namespace to have caps.
