title: [PATCH] Fix get_unmapped_area and fsync for hugetlb shm segments
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=516dffdcd8827a40532798602830dfcfc672294c
lines: -6/+26
category: ipc/shm.c

This patch provides the following hugetlb-related fixes to the recent stacked
shm files changes:
 - Update is_file_hugepages() so it will reconize hugetlb shm segments.
 - get_unmapped_area must be called with the nested file struct to handle
   the sfd->file->f_ops->get_unmapped_area == NULL case.
 - The fsync f_op must be wrapped since it is specified in the hugetlbfs
   f_ops.

This is based on proposed fixes from Eric Biederman that were debugged and
tested by me.  Without it, attempting to use hugetlb shared memory segments
on powerpc (and likely ia64) will kill your box.
