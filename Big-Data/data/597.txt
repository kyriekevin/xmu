title: ipc/sem.c: move wake_up_process out of the spinlock section
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=0a2b9d4c79671b05956806ede5d054e03ae56280
lines: -32/+91
category: ipc/sem.c

The wake-up part of semtimedop() consists out of two steps:

- the right tasks must be identified.
- they must be woken up.

Right now, both steps run while the array spinlock is held.  This patch
reorders the code and moves the actual wake_up_process() behind the point
where the spinlock is dropped.

The code also moves setting sem->sem_otime to one place: It does not make
sense to set the last modify time multiple times.
