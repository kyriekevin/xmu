title: shm: fix shmctl(SHM_INFO) lockup with !CONFIG_SHMEM
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=a68e61e8ff2d46327a37b69056998b47745db6fa
lines: -0/+4
category: ipc/shm.c

shm_get_stat() assumes that the inode is a "struct shmem_inode_info",
which is incorrect for !CONFIG_SHMEM (see fs/ramfs/inode.c:
ramfs_get_inode() vs.  mm/shmem.c: shmem_get_inode()).

This bad assumption can cause shmctl(SHM_INFO) to lockup when
shm_get_stat() tries to spin_lock(&info->lock).  Users of !CONFIG_SHMEM
may encounter this lockup simply by invoking the 'ipcs' command.
