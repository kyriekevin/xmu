title: ipc/mqueue.c: fix mq_open() return value
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=d40dcdb0172a1ba853464983a059fb45e0aaf61a
lines: -5/+7
category: ipc/mqueue.c

We return ENOMEM from mqueue_get_inode even when we have enough memory.
Namely in case the system rlimit of mqueue was reached.  This error
propagates to mq_queue and user sees the error unexpectedly.  So fix
this up to properly return EMFILE as described in the manpage:

	EMFILE The process already has the maximum number of files and
	       message queues open.

instead of:

	ENOMEM Insufficient memory.

With the previous patch we just switch to ERR_PTR/PTR_ERR/IS_ERR error
handling here.
