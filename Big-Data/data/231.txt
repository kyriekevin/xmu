Pull Writeback error handling fixes from Jeff Layton:
 "The main rationale for all of these changes is to tighten up writeback
  error reporting to userland. There are many ways now that writeback
  errors can be lost, such that fsync/fdatasync/msync return 0 when
  writeback actually failed.

  This pile contains a small set of cleanups and writeback error
  handling fixes that I was able to break off from the main pile (#2).

  Two of the patches in this pile are trivial. The exceptions are the
  patch to fix up error handling in write_one_page, and the patch to
  make JFS pay attention to write_one_page errors"

* tag 'for-linus-v4.13-1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jlayton/linux:
  fs: remove call_fsync helper function
  mm: clean up error handling in write_one_page
  JFS: do not ignore return code from write_one_page()
  mm: drop "wait" parameter from write_one_page()
