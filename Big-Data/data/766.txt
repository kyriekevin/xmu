title: pid namespaces: changes to show virtual ids to user
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b488893a390edfe027bae7a46e9af8083e740668
lines: -12/+15
category: ipc/mqueue.c ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c 

This is the largest patch in the set. Make all (I hope) the places where
the pid is shown to or get from user operate on the virtual pids.

The idea is:
 - all in-kernel data structures must store either struct pid itself
   or the pid's global nr, obtained with pid_nr() call;
 - when seeking the task from kernel code with the stored id one
   should use find_task_by_pid() call that works with global pids;
 - when showing pid's numerical value to the user the virtual one
   should be used, but however when one shows task's pid outside this
   task's namespace the global one is to be used;
 - when getting the pid from userspace one need to consider this as
   the virtual one and use appropriate task/pid-searching functions.
