title: fs: Preserve error code in get_empty_filp(), part 2
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=39b652527457452f09b35044fb4f8b3b0eabafdf
lines: -1/+2
category: ipc/shm.c

Allocating a file structure in function get_empty_filp() might fail because
of several reasons:
 - not enough memory for file structures
 - operation is not allowed
 - user is over its limit

Currently the function returns NULL in all cases and we loose the exact
reason of the error. All callers of get_empty_filp() assume that the function
can fail with ENFILE only.

Return error through pointer. Change all callers to preserve this error code.

[AV: cleaned up a bit, carved the get_empty_filp() part out into a separate commit
(things remaining here deal with alloc_file()), removed pipe(2) behaviour change]
