title: ipc: set msg back to -EAGAIN if copy wasn't performed
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=2dc958fa2fe6987e7ab106bd97029a09a82fcd8d
lines: -0/+1
category: ipc/msg.c

Make sure that msg pointer is set back to error value in case of
MSG_COPY flag is set and desired message to copy wasn't found.  This
garantees that msg is either a error pointer or a copy address.

Otherwise the last message in queue will be freed without unlinking from
the queue (which leads to memory corruption) and the dummy allocated
copy won't be released.
