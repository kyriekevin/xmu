Pull vfs update from Al Viro:

 - big one - consolidation of descriptor-related logics; almost all of
   that is moved to fs/file.c

   (BTW, I'm seriously tempted to rename the result to fd.c.  As it is,
   we have a situation when file_table.c is about handling of struct
   file and file.c is about handling of descriptor tables; the reasons
   are historical - file_table.c used to be about a static array of
   struct file we used to have way back).

   A lot of stray ends got cleaned up and converted to saner primitives,
   disgusting mess in android/binder.c is still disgusting, but at least
   doesn't poke so much in descriptor table guts anymore.  A bunch of
   relatively minor races got fixed in process, plus an ext4 struct file
   leak.

 - related thing - fget_light() partially unuglified; see fdget() in
   there (and yes, it generates the code as good as we used to have).

 - also related - bits of Cyrill's procfs stuff that got entangled into
   that work; _not_ all of it, just the initial move to fs/proc/fd.c and
   switch of fdinfo to seq_file.

 - Alex's fs/coredump.c spiltoff - the same story, had been easier to
   take that commit than mess with conflicts.  The rest is a separate
   pile, this was just a mechanical code movement.

 - a few misc patches all over the place.  Not all for this cycle,
   there'll be more (and quite a few currently sit in akpm's tree)."

Fix up trivial conflicts in the android binder driver, and some fairly
simple conflicts due to two different changes to the sock_alloc_file()
interface ("take descriptor handling from sock_alloc_file() to callers"
vs "net: Providing protocol type via system.sockprotoname xattr of
/proc/PID/fd entries" adding a dentry name to the socket)
