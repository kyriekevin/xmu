title: IPC: use ipc_buildid() directly from ipc_addid()
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=48dea404ed01869313f1908cca8a15774dcd8ee5
lines: -13/+2
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c ipc/util.c 

By continuing to consolidate a little the IPC code, each id can be built
directly in ipc_addid() instead of having it built from each callers of
ipc_addid()

And I also remove shm_addid() in order to have, as much as possible, the
same code for shm/sem/msg.
