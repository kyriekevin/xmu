title: ipc/sem.c: sem optimise undo list search

Around a month ago, there was some discussion about an improvement of the
sysv sem algorithm: Most (at least: some important) users only use simple
semaphore operations, therefore it's worthwile to optimize this use case.

This patch:

Move last looked up sem_undo struct to the head of the task's undo list.
Attempt to move common entries to the front of the list so search time is
reduced.  This reduces lookup_undo on oprofile of problematic SAP workload
by 30% (see patch 4 for a description of SAP workload).
