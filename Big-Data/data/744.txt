title: IPC: make struct ipc_ids static in ipc_namespace
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=ed2ddbf88c0ddeeae4c78bb306a116dfd867c55c
lines: -102/+23
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/namespace.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c ipc/util.c ipc/util.h 

Each ipc_namespace contains a table of 3 pointers to struct ipc_ids (3 for
msg, sem and shm, structure used to store all ipcs) These 'struct ipc_ids'
are dynamically allocated for each icp_namespace as the ipc_namespace
itself (for the init namespace, they are initialized with pointers to
static variables instead)

It is so for historical reason: in fact, before the use of idr to store the
ipcs, the ipcs were stored in tables of variable length, depending of the
maximum number of ipc allowed.  Now, these 'struct ipc_ids' have a fixed
size.  As they are allocated in any cases for each new ipc_namespace, there
is no gain of memory in having them allocated separately of the struct
ipc_namespace.

This patch proposes to make this table static in the struct ipc_namespace.
Thus, we can allocate all in once and get rid of all the code needed to
allocate and free these ipc_ids separately.
