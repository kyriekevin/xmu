title: mm: Remove slab destructors from kmem_cache_create().
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=20c2df83d25c6a95affe6157a4c9cac4cf5ffaac
lines: -1/+1
category: ipc/mqueue.c

Slab destructors were no longer supported after Christoph's
c59def9f222d44bb7e2f0a559f2906191a0862d7 change. They've been
BUGs for both slab and slub, and slob never supported them
either.

This rips out support for the dtor pointer from kmem_cache_create()
completely and fixes up every single callsite in the kernel (there were
about 224, not including the slab allocator definitions themselves,
or the documentation references).
