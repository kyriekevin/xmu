title: ipc/sem.c: optimize if semops fail
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b6e90822e77cd476c18410f7003197d466e36ac6
lines: -2/+2
category: ipc/sem.c

Reduce the amount of scanning of the list of pending semaphore operations:
If try_atomic_semop failed, then no changes were applied.  Thus no need to
restart.

Additionally, this patch correct an incorrect comment: It's possible to
wait for arbitrary semaphore values (do a dec by <x>, wait-for-zero, inc
by <x> in one atomic operation)

Both changes are from Nick Piggin, the patch is the result of a different
split of the individual changes.
