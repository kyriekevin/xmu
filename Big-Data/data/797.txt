title: [PATCH] mark struct inode_operations const 2
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=92e1d5be91a0e3ffa5c4697eeb09b2aa22792122

Many struct inode_operations in the kernel can be "const".  Marking them const
moves these to the .rodata section, which avoids false sharing with potential
dirty data.  In addition it'll catch accidental writes at compile time to
these shared resources.
