Pull mqueue/bpf vfs cleanups from Al Viro:
 "mqueue and bpf go through rather painful and similar contortions to
  create objects in their dentry trees. Provide a primitive for doing
  that without abusing ->mknod(), switch bpf and mqueue to it.

  Another mqueue-related thing that has ended up in that branch is
  on-demand creation of internal mount (based upon the work of Giuseppe
  Scrivano)"

* 'work.mqueue' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  mqueue: switch to on-demand creation of internal mount
  tidy do_mq_open() up a bit
  mqueue: clean prepare_open() up
  do_mq_open(): move all work prior to dentry_open() into a helper
  mqueue: fold mq_attr_ok() into mqueue_get_inode()
  move dentry_open() calls up into do_mq_open()
  mqueue: switch to vfs_mkobj(), quit abusing ->d_fsdata
  bpf_obj_do_pin(): switch to vfs_mkobj(), quit abusing ->mknod()
  new primitive: vfs_mkobj()
