title: IPC/message queues: introduce msgctl_down
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=a0d092fc2df845a43cc4847836818f49331d0a5c
lines: -73/+89
category: ipc/msg.c

Currently, sys_msgctl is not easy to read.

This patch tries to improve that by introducing the msgctl_down function to
handle all commands requiring the rwmutex to be taken in write mode (ie
IPC_SET and IPC_RMID for now).  It is the equivalent function of semctl_down
for message queues.

This greatly changes the readability of sys_msgctl and also harmonizes the way
these commands are handled among all IPCs.
