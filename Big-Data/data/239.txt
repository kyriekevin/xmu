Pull sched.h split-up from Ingo Molnar:
 "The point of these changes is to significantly reduce the
  <linux/sched.h> header footprint, to speed up the kernel build and to
  have a cleaner header structure.

  After these changes the new <linux/sched.h>'s typical preprocessed
  size goes down from a previous ~0.68 MB (~22K lines) to ~0.45 MB (~15K
  lines), which is around 40% faster to build on typical configs.

  Not much changed from the last version (-v2) posted three weeks ago: I
  eliminated quirks, backmerged fixes plus I rebased it to an upstream
  SHA1 from yesterday that includes most changes queued up in -next plus
  all sched.h changes that were pending from Andrew.

  I've re-tested the series both on x86 and on cross-arch defconfigs,
  and did a bisectability test at a number of random points.

  I tried to test as many build configurations as possible, but some
  build breakage is probably still left - but it should be mostly
  limited to architectures that have no cross-compiler binaries
  available on kernel.org, and non-default configurations"
