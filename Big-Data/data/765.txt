title: ipc: store ipcs into IDRs
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=7ca7e564e049d8b350ec9d958ff25eaa24226352
lines: -310/+330
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c ipc/util.c ipc/util.h 

This patch introduces ipcs storage into IDRs. The main changes are:
  . This ipc_ids structure is changed: the entries array is changed into a
    root idr structure.
  . The grow_ary() routine is removed: it is not needed anymore when adding
    an ipc structure, since we are now using the IDR facility.
  . The ipc_rmid() routine interface is changed:
       . there is no need for this routine to return the pointer passed in as
         argument: it is now declared as a void
       . since the id is now part of the kern_ipc_perm structure, no need to
         have it as an argument to the routine
