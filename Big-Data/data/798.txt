title: [PATCH] mark struct file_operations const 7
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=9a32144e9d7b4e21341174b1a83b82a82353be86

Many struct file_operations in the kernel can be "const".  Marking them const
moves these to the .rodata section, which avoids false sharing with potential
dirty data.  In addition it'll catch accidental writes at compile time to
these shared resources.
