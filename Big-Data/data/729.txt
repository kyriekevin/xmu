title: ipc: do not recompute msgmni anymore if explicitly set by user
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=91cfb2b4b57816de0c96de417b3238249f0b125f
lines: -2/+41
category: ipc/ipc_sysctl.c

Make msgmni not recomputed anymore upon ipc namespace creation / removal or
memory add/remove, as soon as it has been set from userland.

As soon as msgmni is explicitly set via procfs or sysctl(), the associated
callback routine is unregistered from the ipc namespace notifier chain.
