title: [PATCH] IPC: access to unmapped vmalloc area in grow_ary()
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=a9a5cd5d2a57fb76dbae2115450f777b69beccf7
lines: -2/+1
category: ipc/util.c

grow_ary() should not copy struct ipc_id_ary (it copies new->p, not
new). Due to this, memcpy() src pointer could hit unmapped vmalloc page
when near page boundary.
