Pull vfs pile #2 from Al Viro:
 "Next pile (and there'll be one or two more).

  The large piece in this one is getting rid of /proc/*/ns/* weirdness;
  among other things, it allows to (finally) make nameidata completely
  opaque outside of fs/namei.c, making for easier further cleanups in
  there"

* 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  coda_venus_readdir(): use file_inode()
  fs/namei.c: fold link_path_walk() call into path_init()
  path_init(): don't bother with LOOKUP_PARENT in argument
  fs/namei.c: new helper (path_cleanup())
  path_init(): store the "base" pointer to file in nameidata itself
  make default ->i_fop have ->open() fail with ENXIO
  make nameidata completely opaque outside of fs/namei.c
  kill proc_ns completely
  take the targets of /proc/*/ns/* symlinks to separate fs
  bury struct proc_ns in fs/proc
  copy address of proc_ns_ops into ns_common
  new helpers: ns_alloc_inum/ns_free_inum
  make proc_ns_operations work with struct ns_common * instead of void *
  switch the rest of proc_ns_operations to working with &...->ns
  netns: switch ->get()/->put()/->install()/->inum() to working with &net->ns
  make mntns ->get()/->put()/->install()/->inum() work with &mnt_ns->ns
  common object embedded into various struct ....ns
