Pull compat time conversion changes from Peter Anvin:
 "Despite the branch name this is really neither an x86 nor an
  x32-specific patchset, although it the implementation of the
  discussions that followed the x32 security hole a few months ago.

  This removes get/put_compat_timespec/val() and replaces them with
  compat_get/put_timespec/val() which are savvy as to the current status
  of COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME.

  It removes several unused and/or incorrect/misleading functions (like
  compat_put_timeval_convert which doesn't in fact do any conversion)
  and also replaces several open-coded implementations what is now
  called compat_convert_timespec() with that function"

* 'x86-x32-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip:
  compat: Fix sparse address space warnings
  compat: Get rid of (get|put)_compat_time(val|spec)
