title: shm: fix the filename of hugetlb sysv shared memory
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=9d66586f7723b73c5925c7c7819c260484627851

Some user space tools need to identify SYSV shared memory when examining
/proc/<pid>/maps.  To do so they look for a block device with major zero, a
dentry named SYSV<sysv key>, and having the minor of the internal sysv
shared memory kernel mount.

To help these tools and to make it easier for people just browsing
/proc/<pid>/maps this patch modifies hugetlb sysv shared memory to use the
SYSV<key> dentry naming convention.

User space tools will still have to be aware that hugetlb sysv shared
memory lives on a different internal kernel mount and so has a different
block device minor number from the rest of sysv shared memory.
