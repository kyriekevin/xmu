title: ipc: only output msgmni value at boot time
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=dfcceb26f89da86ec4ac9583c4515504af8c6c84

When posting:
[PATCH 1/8] Scaling msgmni to the amount of lowmem
(see http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/11/171), I have added a KERN_INFO message
that is output each time msgmni is recomputed.

In http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/29/575 Tony Luck complained that this
message references an ipc namespace address that is useless.

I first thought of using an audit_log instead of a printk, as suggested by
Serge Hallyn.  But unfortunately, we do not have any other information
than the namespace address to provide here too.  So I chose to move the
message and output it only at boot time, removing the reference to the
namespace.
