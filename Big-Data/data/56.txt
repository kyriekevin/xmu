title: ipc/msg.c: update and document memory barriers
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=0d97a82ba830d89a1e541cc9cd11f1e38c28e416
lines: -7/+36
category: ipc/msg.c

Transfer findings from ipc/mqueue.c:

- A control barrier was missing for the lockless receive case So in
  theory, not yet initialized data may have been copied to user space -
  obviously only for architectures where control barriers are not NOP.

- use smp_store_release().  In theory, the refount may have been
  decreased to 0 already when wake_q_add() tries to get a reference.
