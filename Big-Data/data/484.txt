title: mm: make do_mmap_pgoff return populate as a size in bytes, not as a bool
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=41badc15cbad0350de34408c1b0c690f9df76d4b

do_mmap_pgoff() rounds up the desired size to the next PAGE_SIZE
multiple, however there was no equivalent code in mm_populate(), which
caused issues.

This could be fixed by introduced the same rounding in mm_populate(),
however I think it's preferable to make do_mmap_pgoff() return populate
as a size rather than as a boolean, so we don't have to duplicate the
size rounding logic in mm_populate().
