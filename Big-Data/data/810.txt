title: [PATCH] Fix ipc entries removal
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=c7e12b838989b0e432c7a1cdf1e6c6fd936007f6
lines: -1/+16

Fix two issuses related to ipc_ids->entries freeing.

1. When freeing ipc namespace we need to free entries allocated
   with ipc_init_ids().

2. When removing old entries in grow_ary() ipc_rcu_putref()
   may be called on entries set to &ids->nullentry earlier in
   ipc_init_ids().
   This is almost impossible without namespaces, but with
   them this situation becomes possible.

Found during OpenVZ testing after obvious leaks in beancounters.
