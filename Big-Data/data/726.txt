title: IPC/shared memory: introduce shmctl_down
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=8d4cc8b5c5e5bac526618ee704f3cfdcad954e0c
lines: -88/+72
category: ipc/shm.c

Currently, the way the different commands are handled in sys_shmctl introduces
some duplicated code.

This patch introduces the shmctl_down function to handle all the commands
requiring the rwmutex to be taken in write mode (ie IPC_SET and IPC_RMID for
now).  It is the equivalent function of semctl_down for shared memory.

This removes some duplicated code for handling these both commands and
harmonizes the way they are handled among all IPCs.
