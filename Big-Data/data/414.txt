title: IPC: bugfix for msgrcv with msgtyp < 0
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=368ae537e056acd3f751fa276f48423f06803922
lines: -2/+3
category: ipc/msg.c

According to 'man msgrcv': "If msgtyp is less than 0, the first message of
the lowest type that is less than or equal to the absolute value of msgtyp
shall be received."

Bug: The kernel only returns a message if its type is 1; other messages
with type < abs(msgtype) will never get returned.

Fix: After having traversed the list to find the first message with the
lowest type, we need to actually return that message.

This regression was introduced by commit daaf74cf0867 ("ipc: refactor
msg list search into separate function")
