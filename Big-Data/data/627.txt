title: ipc ns: fix memory leak (idr)
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=7d6feeb287c61aafa88f06345387b1188edf4b86

We have apparently had a memory leak since
7ca7e564e049d8b350ec9d958ff25eaa24226352 "ipc: store ipcs into IDRs" in
2007.  The idr of which 3 exist for each ipc namespace is never freed.

This patch simply frees them when the ipcns is freed.  I don't believe any
idr_remove() are done from rcu (and could therefore be delayed until after
this idr_destroy()), so the patch should be safe.  Some quick testing
showed no harm, and the memory leak fixed.

Caught by kmemleak.
