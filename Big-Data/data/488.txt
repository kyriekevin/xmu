title: userns: Allow the unprivileged users to mount mqueue fs
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=bc1b69ed22a704fb1cc83d75b2eb46508a06c820

This patch allow the unprivileged user to mount mqueuefs in
user ns.

If two userns share the same ipcns,the files in mqueue fs
should be seen in both these two userns.

If the userns has its own ipcns,it has its own mqueue fs too.
ipcns has already done this job well.
