title: sysvipc: fix the ipc structures initialization
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=e00b4ff7ebf098b11b11be403921c1cf41d9e321
lines: -5/+9
category: ipc/util.c

A problem was found while reviewing the code after Bugzilla bug
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11796.

In ipc_addid(), the newly allocated ipc structure is inserted into the
ipcs tree (i.e made visible to readers) without locking it.  This is not
correct since its initialization continues after it has been inserted in
the tree.

This patch moves the ipc structure lock initialization + locking before
the actual insertion.
