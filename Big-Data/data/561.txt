title: Do 'shm_init_ns()' in an early pure_initcall
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=140d0b2108faebc77c6523296e211e509cb9f5f9
lines: -1/+8
category: ipc/shm.c

This isn't really critical any more, since other patches (commit
298507d4d2cf: "shm: optimize exit_shm()") have caused us to not actually
need to touch the rw_mutex unless there are actual shm segments
associated with the namespace, but we really should do tne shm_init_ns()
earlier than we do now.

This, together with commit 288d5abec831 ("Boot up with usermodehelper
disabled") will mean that we really do initialize the initial ipc
namespace data structure before we run any tasks.
