title: [PATCH] NOMMU: Make SYSV IPC SHM use ramfs facilities on NOMMU
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b0e15190ead07056ab0c3844a499ff35e66d27cc
lines: -5/+13
category: ipc/shm.c

The attached patch makes the SYSV IPC shared memory facilities use the new
ramfs facilities on a no-MMU kernel.

The following changes are made:

 (1) There are now shmem_mmap() and shmem_get_unmapped_area() functions to
     allow the IPC SHM facilities to commune with the tiny-shmem and shmem
     code.

 (2) ramfs files now need resizing using do_truncate() rather than by modifying
     the inode size directly (see shmem_file_setup()). This causes ramfs to
     attempt to bind a block of pages of sufficient size to the inode.

 (3) CONFIG_SYSVIPC is no longer contingent on CONFIG_MMU.
