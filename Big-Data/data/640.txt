title: ipc: unbreak 32-bit shmctl/semctl/msgctl
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=232086b19964d0e13359d30d74b11ca31b0751cb
lines: -0/+1
category: ipc/util.h

31a985f "ipc: use __ARCH_WANT_IPC_PARSE_VERSION in ipc/util.h" would
choose the implementation of ipc_parse_version() based on a symbol
defined in <asm/unistd.h>.

But it failed to also include this header and thus broke
IPC_64-passing 32-bit userspace because the flag wasn't masked out
properly anymore and the command not understood.

Include <linux/unistd.h> to give the architecture a chance to ask for
the no-no-op ipc_parse_version().
