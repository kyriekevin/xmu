title: sanitize AUDIT_MQ_SENDRECV
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=c32c8af43b9adde8d6f938d8e6328c13b8de79ac
lines: -24/+30
category: ipc/mqueue.c

* logging the original value of *msg_prio in mq_timedreceive(2)
  is insane - the argument is write-only (i.e. syscall always
  ignores the original value and only overwrites it).
* merge __audit_mq_timed{send,receive}
* don't do copy_from_user() twice
* don't mess with allocations in auditsc part
* ... and don't bother checking !audit_enabled and !context in there -
  we'd already checked for audit_dummy_context().
