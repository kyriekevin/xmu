title: [PATCH] sysctl: move SYSV IPC sysctls to their own file
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=a5494dcd8b92dce64317f2f7dd0d62747c54980b
lines: -0/+184
category: ipc/Makefile 

This is just a simple cleanup to keep kernel/sysctl.c from getting to crowded
with special cases, and by keeping all of the ipc logic to together it makes
the code a little more readable.
