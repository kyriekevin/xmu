title: shm: optimize exit_shm()

We may optimistically check .in_use == 0 without holding the rw_mutex:
it's the common case, and if it's zero, there certainly won't be any
segments associated with us.

After taking the lock, the idr_for_each() will do the right thing, so we
could now drop the re-check inside the lock without any real cost.  But
it won't hurt.
