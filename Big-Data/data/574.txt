title: mm: don't access vm_flags as 'int'

The type of vma->vm_flags is 'unsigned long'. Neither 'int' nor
'unsigned int'. This patch fixes such misuse.

[ Changed to use a typedef - we'll extend it to cover more cases
  later, since there has been discussion about making it a 64-bit
  type..                      - Linus ]
