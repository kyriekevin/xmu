title: ipc: introduce ksys_ipc()/compat_ksys_ipc() for s390
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=58fa4a410fc31afe08d0d0c6b6d8860c22ec17c2

category: ipc/syscall.c

The sys_ipc() and compat_ksys_ipc() functions are meant to only
be used from the system call table, not called by another function.

Introduce ksys_*() interfaces for this purpose, as we have done
for many other system calls.
