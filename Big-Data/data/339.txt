Pull namespace updates from Eric Biederman:
 "This is a bunch of small changes built against 3.16-rc6.  The most
  significant change for users is the first patch which makes setns
  drmatically faster by removing unneded rcu handling.

  The next chunk of changes are so that "mount -o remount,.." will not
  allow the user namespace root to drop flags on a mount set by the
  system wide root.  Aks this forces read-only mounts to stay read-only,
  no-dev mounts to stay no-dev, no-suid mounts to stay no-suid, no-exec
  mounts to stay no exec and it prevents unprivileged users from messing
  with a mounts atime settings.  I have included my test case as the
  last patch in this series so people performing backports can verify
  this change works correctly.

  The next change fixes a bug in NFS that was discovered while auditing
  nsproxy users for the first optimization.  Today you can oops the
  kernel by reading /proc/fs/nfsfs/{servers,volumes} if you are clever
  with pid namespaces.  I rebased and fixed the build of the
  !CONFIG_NFS_FS case yesterday when a build bot caught my typo.  Given
  that no one to my knowledge bases anything on my tree fixing the typo
  in place seems more responsible that requiring a typo-fix to be
  backported as well.

  The last change is a small semantic cleanup introducing
  /proc/thread-self and pointing /proc/mounts and /proc/net at it.  This
  prevents several kinds of problemantic corner cases.  It is a
  user-visible change so it has a minute chance of causing regressions
  so the change to /proc/mounts and /proc/net are individual one line
  commits that can be trivially reverted.  Unfortunately I lost and
  could not find the email of the original reporter so he is not
  credited.  From at least one perspective this change to /proc/net is a
  refgression fix to allow pthread /proc/net uses that were broken by
  the introduction of the network namespace"
