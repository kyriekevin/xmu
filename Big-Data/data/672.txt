title: [CVE-2009-0029] System call wrapper special cases
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=6673e0c3fbeaed2cd08e2fd4a4aa97382d6fedb0

System calls with an unsigned long long argument can't be converted with
the standard wrappers since that would include a cast to long, which in
turn means that we would lose the upper 32 bit on 32 bit architectures.
Also semctl can't use the standard wrapper since it has a 'union'
parameter.

So we handle them as special case and add some extra wrappers instead.
