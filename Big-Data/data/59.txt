title: treewide: Use sizeof_field() macro
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=c593642c8be046915ca3a4a300243a68077cd207

Replace all the occurrences of FIELD_SIZEOF() with sizeof_field() except
at places where these are defined. Later patches will remove the unused
definition of FIELD_SIZEOF().

This patch is generated using following script:

EXCLUDE_FILES="include/linux/stddef.h|include/linux/kernel.h"

git grep -l -e "\bFIELD_SIZEOF\b" | while read file;
do

	if [[ "$file" =~ $EXCLUDE_FILES ]]; then
		continue
	fi
	sed -i  -e 's/\bFIELD_SIZEOF\b/sizeof_field/g' $file;
done
