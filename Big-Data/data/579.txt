title: userns: user namespaces: convert several capable() calls
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b0e77598f87107001a00b8a4ece9c95e4254ccc4
lines: -29/+42
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/namespace.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c ipc/util.c ipc/util.h 

CAP_IPC_OWNER and CAP_IPC_LOCK can be checked against current_user_ns(),
because the resource comes from current's own ipc namespace.

setuid/setgid are to uids in own namespace, so again checks can be against
current_user_ns().

Changelog:
	Jan 11: Use task_ns_capable() in place of sched_capable().
	Jan 11: Use nsown_capable() as suggested by Bastian Blank.
	Jan 11: Clarify (hopefully) some logic in futex and sched.c
	Feb 15: use ns_capable for ipc, not nsown_capable
	Feb 23: let copy_ipcs handle setting ipc_ns->user_ns
	Feb 23: pass ns down rather than taking it from current
