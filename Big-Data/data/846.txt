title: [NETLINK]: Fix a severe bug
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=a70ea994a0d83fd0151a070be72b87d014ef0a7e

netlink overrun was broken while improvement of netlink.
Destination socket is used in the place where it was meant to be source socket,
so that now overrun is never sent to user netlink sockets, when it should be,
and it even can be set on kernel socket, which results in complete deadlock
of rtnetlink.

Suggested fix is to restore status quo passing source socket as additional
argument to netlink_attachskb().

A little explanation: overrun is set on a socket, when it failed
to receive some message and sender of this messages does not or even
have no way to handle this error. This happens in two cases:
1. when kernel sends something. Kernel never retransmits and cannot
   wait for buffer space.
2. when user sends a broadcast and the message was not delivered
   to some recipients.
