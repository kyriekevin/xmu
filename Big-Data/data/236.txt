Pull namespace updates from Eric Biederman:
 "This is a set of small fixes that were mostly stumbled over during
  more significant development. This proc fix and the fix to
  posix-timers are the most significant of the lot.

  There is a lot of good development going on but unfortunately it
  didn't quite make the merge window"

  signal: Remove unused definition of sig_user_definied

  ipc: Remove unused declaration of recompute_msgmni
