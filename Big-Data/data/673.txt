title: [CVE-2009-0029] Convert all system calls to return a long
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=2ed7c03ec17779afb4fcfa3b8c61df61bd4879ba

Convert all system calls to return a long. This should be a NOP since all
converted types should have the same size anyway.
With the exception of sys_exit_group which returned void. But that doesn't
matter since the system call doesn't return.
