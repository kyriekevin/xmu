title: IPC: get rid of the use *_setbuf structure.
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=016d7132f246a05e6e34ccba157fa278a96c45ae
lines: -86/+46
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c 

All IPCs make use of an intermetiate *_setbuf structure to handle the IPC_SET
command.  This is not really needed and, moreover, it complicates a little bit
the code.

This patch gets rid of the use of it and uses directly the semid64_ds/
msgid64_ds/shmid64_ds structure.

In addition of removing one struture declaration, it also simplifies and
improves a little bit the common 64-bits path.
