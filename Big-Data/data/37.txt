title: mm: remove unnecessary wrapper function do_mmap_pgoff()
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=45e55300f11495ed58c53427da7f0d958800a30f
lines: -1/+1
category: ipc/shm.c

The current split between do_mmap() and do_mmap_pgoff() was introduced in
commit 1fcfd8db7f82 ("mm, mpx: add "vm_flags_t vm_flags" arg to
do_mmap_pgoff()") to support MPX.

The wrapper function do_mmap_pgoff() always passed 0 as the value of the
vm_flags argument to do_mmap().  However, MPX support has subsequently
been removed from the kernel and there were no more direct callers of
do_mmap(); all calls were going via do_mmap_pgoff().

Simplify the code by removing do_mmap_pgoff() and changing all callers to
directly call do_mmap(), which now no longer takes a vm_flags argument.
