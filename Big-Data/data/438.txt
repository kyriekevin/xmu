title: hugetlbfs: fix mmap failure in unaligned size request
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=af73e4d9506d3b797509f3c030e7dcd554f7d9c4
lines: -1/+5
category: ipc/shm.c

The current kernel returns -EINVAL unless a given mmap length is
"almost" hugepage aligned.  This is because in sys_mmap_pgoff() the
given length is passed to vm_mmap_pgoff() as it is without being aligned
with hugepage boundary.

This is a regression introduced in commit 40716e29243d ("hugetlbfs: fix
alignment of huge page requests"), where alignment code is pushed into
hugetlb_file_setup() and the variable len in caller side is not changed.

To fix this, this patch partially reverts that commit, and adds
alignment code in caller side.  And it also introduces hstate_sizelog()
in order to get proper hstate to specified hugepage size.
