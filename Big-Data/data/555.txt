title: vfs: fix the stupidity with i_dentry in inode destructors
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=6b520e0565422966cdf1c3759bd73df77b0f248c
lines: -1/+0
category: ipc/mqueue.c

Seeing that just about every destructor got that INIT_LIST_HEAD() copied into
it, there is no point whatsoever keeping this INIT_LIST_HEAD in inode_init_once();
the cost of taking it into inode_init_always() will be negligible for pipes
and sockets and negative for everything else.  Not to mention the removal of
boilerplate code from ->destroy_inode() instances...
