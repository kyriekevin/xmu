title: IPC: cleanup some code and wrong comments about semundo list managment
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=c530c6ac7eb1d4ae1ff6b382d9211be446ee82c6
lines: -40/+6
category: ipc/sem.c

Some comments about sem_undo_list seem wrong.
About the comment above unlock_semundo:
"... If task2 now exits before task1 releases the lock (by calling
unlock_semundo()), then task1 will never call spin_unlock(). ..."

This is just wrong, I see no reason for which task1 will not call
spin_unlock... The rest of this comment is also wrong... Unless I
miss something (of course).

Finally, (un)lock_semundo functions are useless, so remove them
for simplification. (this avoids an useless if statement)
