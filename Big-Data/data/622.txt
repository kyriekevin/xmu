title: ipc/sem.c: add a per-semaphore pending list
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b97e820ffffbf49e94ed60c9c26f1a54bccae924

Based on Nick's findings:

sysv sem has the concept of semaphore arrays that consist out of multiple
semaphores.  Atomic operations that affect multiple semaphores are
supported.

The patch is the first step for optimizing simple, single semaphore
operations: In addition to the global list of all pending operations, a
2nd, per-semaphore list with the simple operations is added.

Note: this patch does not make sense by itself, the new list is used
nowhere.
