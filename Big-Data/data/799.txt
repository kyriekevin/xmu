title: [PATCH] ipc: save the ipc namespace while reading proc files
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=bc1fc6d88c646ea071de34250552051a63000d70
lines: -13/+45
category: ipc/util.c

The problem we were assuming that current->nsproxy->ipc_ns would never
change while someone has our file in /proc/sysvipc/ file open.  Given that
this can change with both unshare and by passing the file descriptor to
another process that assumption is occasionally wrong.

Therefore this patch causes /proc/sysvipc/* to cache the namespace and
increment it's count when we open the file and to decrement the count when
we close the file, ensuring consistent operation with no surprises.
