title: [PATCH] compat: be more consistent about [ug]id_t
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=202e5979af4d91c7ca05892641131dee22653259

When I first wrote the compat layer patches, I was somewhat cavalier about
the definition of compat_uid_t and compat_gid_t (or maybe I just
misunderstood :-)).  This patch makes the compat types much more consistent
with the types we are being compatible with and hopefully will fix a few
bugs along the way.

	compat type		type in compat arch
	__compat_[ug]id_t	__kernel_[ug]id_t
	__compat_[ug]id32_t	__kernel_[ug]id32_t
	compat_[ug]id_t		[ug]id_t

The difference is that compat_uid_t is always 32 bits (for the archs we
care about) but __compat_uid_t may be 16 bits on some.
