title: IPC: fix error case when idr-cache is empty in ipcget()
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=283bb7fada7e33a759d8fc9bd7a44532e4ad420e
lines: -11/+18
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c ipc/util.c 

With the use of idr to store the ipc, the case where the idr cache is
empty, when idr_get_new is called (this may happen even if we call
idr_pre_get() before), is not well handled: it lets
semget()/shmget()/msgget() return ENOSPC when this cache is empty, what 1.
does not reflect the facts and 2.  does not conform to the man(s).

This patch fixes this by retrying the whole process of allocation in this case.
