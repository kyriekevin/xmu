title: [PATCH] shmdt cannot detach not-alined shm segment cleanly.
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=8e36709d8cea48a4d341294ce2b46678a2e77159

sys_shmdt() can manage shm segments which are covered by multiple vmas.  (This
can happen when a user uses mprotect() after shmat().)

This works well if shm is aligned to PAGE_SIZE, but if not, the last
segment cannot be detached.  It is because a comparison in sys_shmdt()

	(vma->vm_end - addr) < size
		addr == return address of shmat()
		size == shmsize, argments to shmget()

size should be aligned to PAGE_SIZE before being compared with vma->vm_end,
which is aligned.
