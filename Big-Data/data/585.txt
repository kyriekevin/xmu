title: ipc/shm.c: add RSS and swap size information to /proc/sysvipc/shm
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b795218075a1e1183169abb66a90dcdcf30367f9
lines: -21/+42
category: ipc/shm.c

The kernel currently provides no functionality to analyze the RSS and swap
space usage of each individual sysvipc shared memory segment.

This patch adds this info for each existing shm segment by extending the
output of /proc/sysvipc/shm by two columns for RSS and swap.

Since shmctl(SHM_INFO) already provides a similiar calculation (it
currently sums up all RSS/swap info for all segments), I did split out a
static function which is now used by the /proc/sysvipc/shm output and
shmctl(SHM_INFO).

SAP products (esp.  the SAP Netweaver ABAP Kernel) uses lots of big shared
memory segments (we often have Linux systems with >= 16GB shm usage).
Sometimes we get customer reports about "slow" system responses and while
looking into their configurations we often find massive swapping activity
on the system.  With this patch it's now easy to see from the command line
if and which shm segments gets swapped out (and how much) and can more
easily give recommendations for system tuning.  Without the patch it's
currently not possible to do such shm analysis at all.

Also...

Add some spaces in front of the "size" field for 64bit kernels to get the
columns correct if you cat the contents of the file.  In
sysvipc_shm_proc_show() the kernel prints the size value in "SPEC_SIZE"
format, which is defined like this:

#if BITS_PER_LONG <= 32
#define SIZE_SPEC "%10lu"
#else
#define SIZE_SPEC "%21lu"
#endif

So, if the header is not adjusted, the columns are not correctly aligned.
I actually tested this on 32- and 64-bit and it seems correct now.
