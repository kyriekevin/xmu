title: mempolicy: fixup Fallback for Default Shmem Policy
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=ae4d8c16aa22775f5731677abb8a82f03cec877e

get_vma_policy() is not handling fallback to task policy correctly when the
get_policy() vm_op returns NULL.  The NULL overwrites the 'pol' variable that
was holding the fallback task mempolicy.  So, it was falling back directly to
system default policy.

Fix get_vma_policy() to use only non-NULL policy returned from the vma
get_policy op.

shm_get_policy() was falling back to current task's mempolicy if the "backing
file system" [tmpfs vs hugetlbfs] does not support the get_policy vm_op and
the vma policy is null.  This is incorrect for show_numa_maps() which is
likely querying the numa_maps of some task other than current.  Remove this
fallback.
