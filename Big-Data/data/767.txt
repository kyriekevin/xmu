title: sysctl mqueue: remove the binary sysctl numbers
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=97aeacf49239d7f829b8cbfaca05530c97ccb903
lines: -10/+0
category: ipc/mqueue.c

Because of a conflict with FS_INODE_NR none of the binary sysctl numbers use
by mqueue, were available to user space.  So just remove them.
