title: /proc/sysvipc/shm: fix 32-bit truncation of segment sizes
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=6c826818ff55eae7702b778b5f8bdf765af3b2af
lines: -8/+8
category: ipc/shm.c

sysvipc_shm_proc_show() picks between format strings (based on the
expected maximum length of a SHM segment) in a way that prevents gcc from
performing format checks on the seq_printf() parameters.  This hid two
format errors - shp->shm_segsz and shp->shm_nattach are both unsigned
long, but were being printed as unsigned int and signed int respectively.
This leads to 32-bit truncation of SHM segment sizes reported in
/proc/sysvipc/shm.  (And for nattach, but that's less of a problem for
most users).

This patch makes the format string directly visible to gcc's format
specifier checker, and fixes the two broken format specifiers.
