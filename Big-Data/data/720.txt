title: IPC: consolidate all xxxctl_down() functions
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=a5f75e7f256f75759ec3d6dbef0ba932f1b397d2
lines: -119/+66
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c ipc/util.c ipc/util.h 

semctl_down(), msgctl_down() and shmctl_down() are used to handle the same set
of commands for each kind of IPC.  They all start to do the same job (they
retrieve the ipc and do some permission checks) before handling the commands
on their own.

This patch proposes to consolidate this by moving these same pieces of code
into one common function called ipcctl_pre_down().

It simplifies a little these xxxctl_down() functions and increases a little
the maintainability.
