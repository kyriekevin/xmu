Pull namespace updates from Eric Biederman:
 "There was a lot of work this cycle fixing bugs that were discovered
  after the merge window and getting everything ready where we can
  reasonably support fully unprivileged fuse. The bug fixes you already
  have and much of the unprivileged fuse work is coming in via other
  trees.

  Still left for fully unprivileged fuse is figuring out how to cleanly
  handle .set_acl and .get_acl in the legacy case, and properly handling
  of evm xattrs on unprivileged mounts.

  Included in the tree is a cleanup from Alexely that replaced a linked
  list with a statically allocated fix sized array for the pid caches,
  which simplifies and speeds things up.

  Then there is are some cleanups and fixes for the ipc namespace. The
  motivation was that in reviewing other code it was discovered that
  access ipc objects from different pid namespaces recorded pids in such
  a way that when asked the wrong pids were returned. In the worst case
  there has been a measured 30% performance impact for sysvipc
  semaphores. Other test cases showed no measurable performance impact.
  Manfred Spraul and Davidlohr Bueso who tend to work on sysvipc
  performance both gave the nod that this is good enough.

  Casey Schaufler and James Morris have given their approval to the LSM
  side of the changes.

  I simplified the types and the code dealing with sysvipc to pass just
  kern_ipc_perm for all three types of ipc. Which reduced the header
  dependencies throughout the kernel and simplified the lsm code.

  Which let me work on the pid fixes without having to worry about
  trivial changes causing complete kernel recompiles"
