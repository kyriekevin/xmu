title: Restore shmid as inode# to fix /proc/pid/maps ABI breakage
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=30475cc12a50816f290828fb7e3cd7036cd622df
lines: -0/+5
category: ipc/shm.c

shmid used to be stored as inode# for shared memory segments. Some of
the proc-ps tools use this from /proc/pid/maps.  Recent cleanups
to newseg() changed it.  This patch sets inode number back to shared
memory id to fix breakage.
