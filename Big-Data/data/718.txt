title: ipc: sysvsem: implement sys_unshare(CLONE_SYSVSEM)
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=9edff4ab1f8d82675277a04e359d0ed8bf14a7b7
lines: -0/+1
category: ipc/sem.c

sys_unshare(CLONE_NEWIPC) doesn't handle the undo lists properly, this can
cause a kernel memory corruption.  CLONE_NEWIPC must detach from the existing
undo lists.

Fix, part 1: add support for sys_unshare(CLONE_SYSVSEM)

The original reason to not support it was the potential (inevitable?)
confusion due to the fact that sys_unshare(CLONE_SYSVSEM) has the
inverse meaning of clone(CLONE_SYSVSEM).

Our two most reasonable options then appear to be (1) fully support
CLONE_SYSVSEM, or (2) continue to refuse explicit CLONE_SYSVSEM,
but always do it anyway on unshare(CLONE_SYSVSEM).  This patch does
(1).

Changelog:
	Apr 16: SEH: switch to Manfred's alternative patch which
		removes the unshare_semundo() function which
		always refused CLONE_SYSVSEM.
