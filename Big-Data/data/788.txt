title: Cap shmmax at INT_MAX in compat shminfo
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=af7c693f146069a1f44739acef9abf1bc27f7247
lines: -0/+4
category: ipc/compat.c

The value of shmmax may be larger than will fit in the struct used by
the 32bit compat version of sys_shmctl. This change mirrors what the
normal sys_shmctl does when called with the old IPC_INFO command.
