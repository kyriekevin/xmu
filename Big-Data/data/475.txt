title: ipc: don't allocate a copy larger than max
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=88b9e456b1649722673ffa147914299799dc9041
lines: -2/+4
category: ipc/msg.c

When MSG_COPY is set, a duplicate message must be allocated for the copy
before locking the queue.  However, the copy could not be larger than was
sent which is limited to msg_ctlmax.
