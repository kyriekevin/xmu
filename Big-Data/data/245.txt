title: sched/headers: Prepare for new header dependencies before moving code to â†µ
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=8703e8a465b1e9cadc3680b4b1248f5987e54518
lines: -0/+1
category: ipc/mqueue.c

<linux/sched/user.h>

We are going to split <linux/sched/user.h> out of <linux/sched.h>, which
will have to be picked up from other headers and a couple of .c files.

Create a trivial placeholder <linux/sched/user.h> file that just
maps to <linux/sched.h> to make this patch obviously correct and
bisectable.

Include the new header in the files that are going to need it.
