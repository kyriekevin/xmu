title: hugetlb: fix get_policy for stacked shared memory files
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=22741925d268e8479ef66312749bd8d96ed35365

Here's another breakage as a result of shared memory stacked files :(

The NUMA policy for a VMA is determined by checking the following (in the
order given):

1) vma->vm_ops->get_policy() (if defined)
2) vma->vm_policy (if defined)
3) task->mempolicy (if defined)
4) Fall back to default_policy

By switching to stacked files for shared memory, get_policy() is now always
set to shm_get_policy which is a wrapper function.  This causes us to stop
at step 1, which yields NULL for hugetlb instead of task->mempolicy which
was the previous (and correct) result.

This patch modifies the shm_get_policy() wrapper to maintain steps 1-3 for
the wrapped vm_ops.

(akpm: the refcounting of mempolicies is busted and this patch does nothing to
improve it)
