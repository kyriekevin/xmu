Based on discussion on lkml (Andrew Morton and Eric Paris),
move ima_counts_get down a layer into shmem/hugetlb__file_setup().
Resolves drm shmem_file_setup() usage case as well.

HD comment:
  I still think you're doing this at the wrong level, but recognize
  that you probably won't be persuaded until a few more users of
  alloc_file() emerge, all wanting your ima_counts_get().

  Resolving GEM's shmem_file_setup() is an improvement, so I'll say
