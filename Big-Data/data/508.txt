title: ipc/mqueue: remove unnecessary rb_init_node() calls
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=1638113d9d8b7e04c1eeae9014d43f6381a74040
lines: -3/+0
category: ipc/mqueue.c

Commit d6629859b36d ("ipc/mqueue: improve performance of send/recv") and
ce2d52cc ("ipc/mqueue: add rbtree node caching support") introduced an
rbtree of message priorities, and usage of rb_init_node() to initialize
the corresponding nodes.  As it turns out, rb_init_node() is unnecessary
here, as the nodes are fully initialized on insertion by rb_link_node()
and the code doesn't access nodes that aren't inserted on the rbtree.

Removing the rb_init_node() calls as I removed that function during
rbtree API cleanups (the only other use of it was in a place that
similarly didn't require it).
