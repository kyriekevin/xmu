title: [PATCH] Really ignore kmem_cache_destroy return value
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=1a1d92c10dd24bbdc28b3d6e2d03ec199dd3a65b

* Rougly half of callers already do it by not checking return value
* Code in drivers/acpi/osl.c does the following to be sure:

	(void)kmem_cache_destroy(cache);

* Those who check it printk something, however, slab_error already printed
  the name of failed cache.
* XFS BUGs on failed kmem_cache_destroy which is not the decision
  low-level filesystem driver should make. Converted to ignore.
