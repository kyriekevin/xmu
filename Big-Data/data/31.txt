Pull misc fixes from Christian Brauner:
 "This contains several fixes which felt worth being combined into a
  single branch:

   - Use put_nsproxy() instead of open-coding it switch_task_namespaces()

   - Kirill's work to unify lifecycle management for all namespaces. The
     lifetime counters are used identically for all namespaces types.
     Namespaces may of course have additional unrelated counters and
     these are not altered. This work allows us to unify the type of the
     counters and reduces maintenance cost by moving the counter in one
     place and indicating that basic lifetime management is identical
     for all namespaces.

   - Peilin's fix adding three byte padding to Dmitry's
     PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO uapi struct to prevent an info leak.

   - Two smal patches to convert from the /* fall through */ comment
     annotation to the fallthrough keyword annotation which I had taken
     into my branch and into -next before df561f6688fe ("treewide: Use
     fallthrough pseudo-keyword") made it upstream which fixed this
     tree-wide.

     Since I didn't want to invalidate all testing for other commits I
     didn't rebase and kept them"
