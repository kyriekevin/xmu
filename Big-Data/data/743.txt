title: IPC: consolidate sem_exit_ns(), msg_exit_ns() and shm_exit_ns()
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=01b8b07a5d77d22e609267dcae74d15e3e9c5f13
lines: -66/+46
category: ipc/msg.c ipc/namespace.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c 

sem_exit_ns(), msg_exit_ns() and shm_exit_ns() are all called when an
ipc_namespace is released to free all ipcs of each type.  But in fact, they
do the same thing: they loop around all ipcs to free them individually by
calling a specific routine.

This patch proposes to consolidate this by introducing a common function,
free_ipcs(), that do the job.  The specific routine to call on each
individual ipcs is passed as parameter.  For this, these ipc-specific
'free' routines are reworked to take a generic 'struct ipc_perm' as
parameter.
