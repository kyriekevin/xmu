title: [NETLINK]: Fix unicast timeouts
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=c3d8d1e30cace31fed6186a4b8c6b1401836d89c
lines: -2/+4
category: ipc/mqueue.c

Commit ed6dcf4a in the history.git tree broke netlink_unicast timeouts
by moving the schedule_timeout() call to a new function that doesn't
propagate the remaining timeout back to the caller. This means on each
retry we start with the full timeout again.

ipc/mqueue.c seems to actually want to wait indefinitely so this
behaviour is retained.
