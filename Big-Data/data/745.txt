title: IPC/semaphores: consolidate SEM_STAT and IPC_STAT commands
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=4b9fcb0ec60584d639ad105c42b75a3447071e47
lines: -22/+16
category: ipc/sem.c

These commands (SEM_STAT and IPC_STAT) are rather doing the same things
(only the meaning of the id given as input and the return value differ).
However, for the semaphores, they are handled in two different places (two
different functions).

This patch consolidates this for clarification by handling these both
commands in the same place in semctl_nolock().  It also removes one unused
parameter for this function.
