title: IPC/semaphores: move the rwmutex handling inside semctl_down
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=522bb2a2b420a0c1d0fcd037aa4e1bb9e2bca447

semctl_down is called with the rwmutex (the one which protects the list of
ipcs) taken in write mode.

This patch moves this rwmutex taken in write-mode inside semctl_down.

This has the advantages of reducing a little bit the window during which this
rwmutex is taken, clarifying sys_semctl, and finally of having a coherent
behaviour with [shm|msg]ctl_down
