link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=72fd4a35a824331d7a0f4168d7576502d95d34b3
lines: -11/+10
category: ipc/util.c

A variety of (mostly) innocuous fixes to the embedded kernel-doc content in
source files, including:

  * make multi-line initial descriptions single line
  * denote some function names, constants and structs as such
  * change erroneous opening '/*' to '/**' in a few places
  * reword some text for clarity
