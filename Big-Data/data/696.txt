title: message queues: increase range limits
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=b231cca4381ee15ec99afbfb244fbc0324869927

Increase the range of various posix message queue limits.

Posix gives the message queue user the ability to 'trade off' the maximum
size of messages with the number of possible messages that can be 'in
flight'.  Linux currently makes this trade off more restrictive than it
needs to be.

In particular, the maximum message size today can be made no smaller than
8192.  This greatly restricts those applications that would like to have
the ability to post large numbers of very small messages.

So this task lowers the limit that the maximum message size can be set to,
from 8192 to 128.  It also lowers the limit that the maximum #number of
messages in flight can be set to, from 10 to 1.

With these changes the message queue user can make better trade offs
between #messages and message size, in order to get everything to fit
within the setrlimit(RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE) limit for that particular user.

This patch also applies the values in

	/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msg_max
	/proc/sys/fs/mqueue/msgsize_max

as the defaults for the max #messages allowed and the max message size
allowed, respectively, for those applications that do not supply these.
Previously, the defaults were hardwired to 10 and 8192, respectively.
