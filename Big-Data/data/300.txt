title: ipc,msg: drop dst nil validation in copy_msg
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=5f2a2d5d423d5337a1392fa016ec23a8a4206006
lines: -1/+0
category: ipc/msgutil.c

d0edd8528362 ("ipc: convert invalid scenarios to use WARN_ON") relaxed the
nil dst parameter check, originally being a full BUG_ON.  However, this
check seems quite unnecessary when the only purpose is for
ceckpoint/restore (MSG_COPY flag):

o The copy variable is set initially to nil, apparently as a way of
  ensuring that prepare_copy is previously called.  Which is in fact done,
  unconditionally at the beginning of do_msgrcv.

o There is no concurrency with 'copy' (stack allocated in do_msgrcv).

Furthermore, any errors in 'copy' (and thus prepare_copy/copy_msg) should
always handled by IS_ERR() family.  Therefore remove this check altogether
as it can never occur with the current users.
