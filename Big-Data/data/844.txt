title: [PATCH] Capture selinux subject/object context information.
link: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/ipc?id=8c8570fb8feef2bc166bee75a85748b25cda22d9

category: ipc/msg.c ipc/sem.c ipc/shm.c 

This patch extends existing audit records with subject/object context
information. Audit records associated with filesystem inodes, ipc, and
tasks now contain SELinux label information in the field "subj" if the
item is performing the action, or in "obj" if the item is the receiver
of an action.

These labels are collected via hooks in SELinux and appended to the
appropriate record in the audit code.

This additional information is required for Common Criteria Labeled
Security Protection Profile (LSPP).
